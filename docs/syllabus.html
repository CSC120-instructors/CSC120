<p>Welcome to CSC120: Object-Oriented Programming! Below is some
important information about how the course will run, as well as some
specific “expectation-setting” details about what we will (and won’t!)
cover.</p>
<div id="course-format" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Format</h2>
<p>This is a programming-intensive course, designed to help early-stage
programmers transition into developing software engineers. While
programming can be a truly interesting, challenging and rewarding
intellectual activity, it is almost impossible to learn it without
<strong>a lot of practice</strong>. This takes time, especially for
debugging a troublesome program that isn’t quite working right yet.</p>
<p>For this reason, the course features a <strong>SEMI-FLIPPED
CLASSROOM</strong>. This means occasionally you’ll be asked to watch
short prerecorded introductions for certain topics and complete some
activities <em>before class</em>, and we’ll spend our time together in
class writing code, starting assignments, and applying the concepts from
lecture in real-world contexts. However, this model only works if you
<em>commit to the process</em>… and if this is your first experience in
a semi-flipped classroom, it might feel a little overwhelming. Here are
some useful tips to help orient you to this model (adapted from UC
Boulder’s <a
href="https://www.colorado.edu/assett/2017/03/21/succeeding-flipped-classroom-march-2017-tip">Succeeding
in a Flipped Classroom</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Expect work to be continuous</strong> Rather than
cramming for large exams that happen <em>after</em> classes, you are
required to keep up with frequent assignments, readings, and videos that
are due <em>before</em> class. One way to set yourself up for success is
to get into the habit of completing your pre-class tasks at the
beginning of the semester. Keep up with Discord and Moodle for updates
and assignments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Show up present and prepared</strong> Be present in
class, physically and mentally, to the best of your ability. Be ready
engage in class discussions and activities. Ask questions to clarify
your understanding of concepts, offer your own perspective, and try not
to be afraid of giving “wrong” answers – misconceptions and <em>false
starts are a normal, healthy part of learning</em> (and we professors
guarantee we’ll make plenty of our own mistakes for you to
catch!)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use prerecorded lectures and readings to your
advantage</strong> While watching prerecorded mini-lectures may seem
like a pain (or just a way for your Prof. to get out of lecturing :-P),
they provide opportunities to learn at your own pace as well as get the
perspective of other instructors (as many of the videos we will use to
lay the foundation for this course come from beyond Smith). If you
benefit from rewatching videos or pausing to try something out on your
own, please do! Many students find it helpful to take notes while
watching prerecorded lectures, just like they would in a traditional
class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Your education is everyone’s priority</strong> If you
find yourself spending inordinate time debugging your programs without
really making progress, it’s time to reach out – <em>before you fall
behind</em>, or it affects your work in other courses. Your professors
and TAs are eager to help you find strategies that work for you, and
that enable you to reach your goals in the course. In addition to us,
the college has <a
href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/resources-and-services">many
resources for academic success</a>, all available at no cost.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Give honest feedback</strong> All teaching is improvable,
and so we’ll ask for your feedback often. We want to know what is going
well and what is tough. Being open and constructive will help us to
improve the class, both for future students and for
<em>you</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<div id="course-materials" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Materials</h2>
<p>There is <strong>no required textbook</strong> for this course: all
required readings and videos will be made available through Moodle.
However, the following recommended textbook is a good choice for those
who find them useful as references. It is available for free online, or
you can purchase a hard copy from your favorite bookstore:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java-2e/">Think Java:
How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, 2nd Ed.</a> (Allen Downey and
Chris Mayfield.), O’Reilly, 2019.<br />
<sub>Think Java is a hands-on introduction to computer science and
programming used by many universities and high schools around the world.
Its conciseness, emphasis on vocabulary, and informal tone make it
particularly appealing for readers with little or no experience. The
book starts with the most basic programming concepts and gradually works
its way to advanced object-oriented techniques. In this fully updated
and expanded edition, authors Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield introduce
programming as a means for solving interesting problems. Each chapter
presents material for one week of a college course and includes
exercises to help you practice what you’ve learned.</sub></li>
</ul>

supplies (for this or any of your courses!) please fill out the Academic
Funding Application found at <a

</div>
<div id="what-we-will-cover" class="section level2">
<h2>What We Will Cover</h2>
<p>This course builds a strong foundation in object-oriented
programming. It is designed <strong>for CSC majors who have completed a
first course in programming</strong>. If this isn’t you, don’t worry!
You’re still very much welcome here. Just be mindful that some
self-study before the course starts may be necessary (see <a
href="#regrets">What We WON’T Cover</a>).</p>
<p>Here’s a selection of topics we will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object-oriented programming in Java</li>
<li>Pointers, references, and indirection</li>
<li>Encapsulation</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Abstraction</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="regrets" class="section level2">
<h2>What We <strong>WON’T</strong> Cover</h2>
<p>This course assumes that you have a solid foundation in computational
thinking, either through successful completion of CSC110, high school
curriculum at at AP or IB level, or dedicated self-study. As such, we
expect you to come to class with a solid understanding of the following
topics (which we may recap briefly to establish common language, but
which won’t be covered in substantial detail):</p>
<ul>
<li>Conditionals, math operators, logical operators</li>
<li>Loops and iteration</li>
<li>Variables and data types</li>
<li>Strings</li>
<li>Lists</li>
<li>Dictionaries</li>
<li>Reading and writing to file storage</li>
<li>User inputs and print formatting</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Basic concept of an algorithm</li>
<li>Understanding abstract components (e.g., input, output, storage,
computation)</li>
<li>Awareness of physical components (e.g., hard drive, RAM, CPU,
keyboard)</li>
</ul>
<p>Proficiency with various computer environments and infrastructure
will also come in handy (though we will go over some of this in class
together). Check out the following links to supplemental online courses
through LinkedIn Learning if you’d like some additional support, which
are available for free to all members of the Smith community:</p>

</ul>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="communication" class="section level2">
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>All written communication regarding this course will take place via
<a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> (a cloud-based communication
platform that supports text, voice, and video). This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>#announcements</strong>: Important notices about class
times, deadlines, office hours, etc.</li>
<li><strong>#general</strong>: Introductions and discussion of
course-related material, off-topic ideas, etc.</li>
<li><strong>#questions</strong>: Channel for all non-personal questions.
<em>Don’t be shy if you are puzzled, someone else probably is
too!</em></li>
<li><strong>DMs</strong>: Message your professors directly for matters
that require individual communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you’re not used to Discord at first, it’s not too hard to
learn. The advantages of having all course communications in one place
are compelling. Use Discord!</p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="assessment" class="section level2">
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>There are three forms of assessment in this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weekly programming homework assignments</li>
<li>Two written skill checks (one midterm, one final)</li>
<li>One final programming project</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="homework-labs-and-lateness-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Homework, Labs, and Lateness Policy</h2>
<p>Weekly programming assignments will be introduced in class on
Thursdays (sneak peek on Wednesday nights), and we will work together to
get started on them during class time. Final submissions will be due
Wednesdays at 11:59PM EST. Because our lives and learning do not always
go as planned, every student will be able grant themselves extensions on
homework assignments. Read details on <a href="late-policy.html">how to
request an extension here</a>.</p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="collaboration-and-academic-integrity" class="section level2">
<h2>Collaboration and Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Programming is more fun in groups! Students are strongly encouraged
to form study groups and to collaborate in solving the assignments.
Please ensure that all work you submit is ultimately the product of your
own understanding rather than anyone else’s. You may consult online or
print references on all assignments and labs. Standard language
references showing syntax, usage, documentation, etc. need not be cited;
nor does the course textbook. All other resources must be cited as
described below.</p>
<p>The following information is required for all submitted work:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The names of all collaborating students be listed at the top of the
submission. If you worked alone, please state: “<em>I did not
collaborate with anyone on this assignment.</em>”</li>
<li>A <strong>References</strong> section, with in-line citations to any
external resources you used. Citations should include page numbers (if a
printed resource) or a direct URL (if an online resource). If you did
not use any resources in completing the assignment, please state: “<em>I
did not utilize any external resources in completing this
assignment.</em>” If you include a fragment of code from any source, you
should also credit that source with a comment directly in the code.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="use-of-ai-code-completion-with-attribution"
class="section level2">
<h2>Use of AI Code-Completion with Attribution</h2>
<p>In this course, students are permitted to utilize AI-powered
code-completion tools, provided you do so while adhering to responsible
and ethical practices. These tools can provide valuable assistance in
enhancing your programming efficiency and proficiency. You are permitted
to incorporate AI code-completion suggestions into your coding
assignments and projects, as long as proper attribution is given.
<strong><em>Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT or similar) cannot be used for
written reflections in CSC120.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Using AI Code-Completion:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Attribution:</strong> We’ll treat AI code-completion
tools as “collaborators” in this class. Whenever you get help with your
programming tasks, it is crucial to provide clear and transparent
attribution. Include a comment or annotation in your code specifying
that certain sections were generated with the help of an AI
code-completion tool.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Originality:</strong> While AI code-completion can offer
valuable insights and suggestions, it is important that the final code
reflects <em>your</em> understanding of the material. For this reason,
you should avoid copying generated code without understanding what it
does; instead, use it as a reference to enhance your own programming
skills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning Opportunity:</strong> View AI code-completion as
a supplementary learning resource. Take the time to assess the
suggestions provided by the tool and compare them to your own coding
decisions. This process can contribute to a deeper understanding of the
programming concepts we cover.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Honor Code:</strong> Always prioritize academic
integrity. Plagiarism, which includes submitting someone else’s work
(including AI-generated content) without proper attribution, is a
violation of our community’s ethical standards and course
policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discussion and Collaboration:</strong> While using AI
code-completion, feel free to engage in discussions with peers and
instructors about the generated code and how it aligns with course
concepts. Collaborative learning and constructive feedback can enrich
the educational experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diverse Approaches:</strong> Keep in mind that there are
generally many “right” ways to solve a programming problem. AI-generated
suggestions might present one approach, but exploring alternative
solutions on your own or through discussions is highly
encouraged.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Human Power:</strong> All AI is developed by other humans
and trained on data generated by millions of our peers. Generative AI
regurgitates and remixes existing information. Do not be fooled into
thinking it “knows” more than you.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember: the primary goal of this course is to enhance your
programming skills and understanding of the subject matter. Utilizing AI
code-completion tools with attribution can support this goal, but the
responsibility lies with you to ensure that your work reflects your own
efforts and comprehension.</p>

with the Disability Services Office</a> to request support and
accommodations.</p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="comfy-class-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Comfy Class Policy</h2>
<p>Everyone is welcome to make themselves comfortable in our classroom
and asked to be respectful of one another. When you are communicating,
please practice active listening by focusing on understanding what
others are expressing rather than thinking of how you will respond.
Additionally, keep in mind that our wide array of individual backgrounds
shape our unique perspectives, so please respect one another when we
have sincere differences of opinion.</p>
<p>You may bring beverages or snacks, but please use closed containers
to avoid spills and keep messy foods away from computers. Everyone is
free to use concentration accommodations like fidget toys, knitting,
doodling, moving around, or sitting on the floor; just be mindful your
focus does not disrupt others. Parents and caregivers may bring their
babies and children to class whenever necessary. Learners of all stages
are invited to join us.</p>
